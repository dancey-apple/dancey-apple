# What's up everyone! I'm Dancey.
### Yes, you read my name correctly; Dancey Apple. Pronounced just like it's spelled "Dance-ee". 
(Pink actually wrote a song about me, the lyrics go "Don't get fancy, just get DANCEY!")... I digress. 

## About me!
Like most melenials (*shudder* I know) I grew up with tech. I had an NES/PS1/Etc.. and when they stopped working, it was up to me to troubleshoot and fix it. I'm a natural troubleshooter, motivated learner, and always currious about the world. I'm always looking for new ways to AUTOMATE my life. (I bought a fish, and instead of cleangin the tank myself, I also bought snails to clean the tank for me!).
I've been in Tech since 2017, working in nearly every aspect that did NOT require coding skills, from QA to Incident Management. But I felt that that limited my value and started my code path in 2020 slowly working on self taught lessons on YT and REPLIT. I moved on to the OKCoders 2024 bootcamp and have been coding ever since!
